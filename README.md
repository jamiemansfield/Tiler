Tiler
=====

Tiler is an, MIT-Licensed, program to produce 256x256 tiles for a given image, to a given
zoom level. It will upscale/downscale the tiles as necessary - it is certainly recommended
a image as large as possible is given to Tiler to ensure a good end result. Small images
may want to be provided pre-upscaled, if a certain upscale algorithm is desired. Pixel art
would certainly benefit from this.
